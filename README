Hi, this is a repo for the Mello replicate and some additional techniques that aim to improve the overall
performance of model edit on M-QUAKE dataset. Original paper: https://github.com/princeton-nlp/MQuAKE.

The additional techniques are:
1. hard-code fact-retrieval.
2. hard-code subquestion breakdown.
3. CoT prompting for contradiction detection.

Each feature is independent wrt the others. Therefore, you permute them as you want to. In the "Command" folder, there
are a few pre-written slurm script for you to try ad play around.

Note:
1. if you disable all three features by selecting them (fact_retrieve, subquestion_breakdown, cot_contradiction)
 as False, the setting would be the setting in the original paper.
